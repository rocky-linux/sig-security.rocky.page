# CVE-2023-23583: microcode_ctl: Intel CPUs: execution of MOVSB instructions with redundant REX prefix leads to unintended system behavior

## Summary

As described by [Intel](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/14/4):

Under certain microarchitectural conditions, Intel has identified cases where execution of an instruction (REP MOVSB) encoded with a redundant REX prefix may result in unpredictable system behavior resulting in a system crash/hang, or, in some limited scenarios, may allow escalation of privilege from CPL3 to CPL0.

and by [Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-23583):

A security vulnerability was found in some Intel processors. Execution of REP MOVSB instructions with a redundant REX prefix may result in execution continuing at an incorrect EIP address after a micro-architectural event occurs, potentially allowing privilege escalation, information disclosure and/or a denial of service via local access.

as well as in [CVE-2023-23583](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-23583).
